Given a file species.txt, when the main_tree.cpp file runs it reads the file and sorts the 
data by species with the closest number value then creates a parent node of the average of the two 
values and so forth. 

When two numbers are not closer to each other the program creates right side of the tree to store
values and process continues until species are sorted. 

Then the resulting text is printed where
"(" represents how left in the the the species has been sorted and ) means right  when a opening and
closing parenthesis are found it means we move one level up the tree.
